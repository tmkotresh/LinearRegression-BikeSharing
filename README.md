# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Project

## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive multiple linear regression analysis to predict bike-sharing demand for BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider. The analysis helps understand demand patterns and provides actionable business insights for post-pandemic recovery strategy.

## 🎯 Business Problem
BoomBikes has suffered revenue dips due to COVID-19 and wants to understand bike demand factors to:
- Accelerate revenue growth post-pandemic
- Prepare for market recovery
- Understand demand drivers
- Develop data-driven business strategies

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Bike-sharing daily data (day.csv)
- **Period**: 2018-2019 (730 daily records)
- **Target Variable**: `cnt` (total bike rentals)
- **Features**: Weather, seasonal, and temporal variables

## 🔧 Project Structure
